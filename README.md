The goal of this software project is to scale up an image without losing its resolution. With technological advances and the need for companies and people to display brands, images are increasingly important, as it is from them that products or services are disclosed in a more attractive and communicative way. However, the problem that can harm those who work and depend on the images for their functionality is their quality, because an image with low resolution can impact several fields. For this, essential tools were used, such as Artificial Intelligence, the convolutional neural network, the ESPCN model for image resizing without quality losses. Requirements that the system must provide to the user to achieve the described objectives were addressed. Python programming language and its libraries were used in order to create the graphical user interface. With the training of networks and the support and use of this tool, it was possible to obtain significant improvements in the images and thus achieve the proposed objectives.
